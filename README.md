### About

{protocell:labs} was founded in 2021 as a digital laboratory that merges artistic and research practices. Within the lab, we explore computational structures, mathematical organizational forms, design algorithms, artificial biology, emergent morphogenesis, and digital graphics. Our preferred mode of expression is chain-agnostic, long-form generative collections, which we began releasing on the fxhash.xyz platform in 2021. These collections feature a strong emphasis on complex 3D geometry, choreographed animation, and interactivity.

As a matter of principle, we keep our code open — unminified, unobfuscated, and available in public repositories like GitHub. It is thoroughly documented through code comments, GitHub commits, articles, and recorded talks to serve as a source of inspiration for others. Additionally, the code for our generative collections is stored on-chain on blockchains such as Ethereum and Tezos, or on decentralized protocols like IPFS. We believe that the development of open generative tools, the fusion of artistic expression with scholarship, and the promotion of responsible Web3 practices are missions that every generative artist should embrace.

### Founders

Luka Piskorec and Kane Borg met in Helsinki as researchers in the Aalto Design of Structures group. Both are practicing architects with extensive backgrounds in algorithmic design and digital fabrication, and have been teaching and researching at the university level since 2011 (at ETH Zürich and Aalto University).

### Affiliations

Luka Piskorec co-founded [TEN Studio](https://www.ten.studio/) - architecture, design and research association based in Zürich and Belgrade.

Kane Borg co-founded [Borg Markkula Oy](https://borgmarkkula.com/) -  a computational design consultancy based in Finland.
